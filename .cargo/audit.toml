# RUSTSEC-2024-0437 / CVE-2025-53605
# protobuf 2.28.0 — stack overflow when parsing malformed protobuf input.
# harbor-router uses protobuf as a transitive dependency through the
# `prometheus` crate (metrics exposition only). We never parse protobuf
# from untrusted user input, so this vulnerability is not exploitable here.
# Patched in protobuf >= 3.7.2 (a different semver-incompatible major
# version); an upgrade requires prometheus itself to migrate to protobuf 3.x.
